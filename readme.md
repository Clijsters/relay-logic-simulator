# Relay Logic Simulator

This is a small simulator for electronic circuits built entirely from relays. I made it as a preparation for building a digital clock from electromechanical parts only, speak: relays, switches and lamps. No microprocessors, no semiconductors. As such a project required a completely different kind of thinking, it seemed to be a good idea to verify some basic ideas using software first, so this project was started.

## How to use it
See the example package which demonstrates how to assemble circuits and how to run the simulation.

## Open issues
There are a number of improvements I would like to add to the project:

## Improve existing parts
* improve clock generator to use system precision for the ticks
* introduce artificial ticks for testing not based on real times
* allow to set counter direction
* build graphical user interface to visualize the clock display
* add time adjustment buttons for setting the clock

## Add new parts
* logic gates
* adder
* latch
* ...
